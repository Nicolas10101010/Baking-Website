Project: Making "Zimt Schnecken"

First we need the Ingredients:

For the yeast dough:
250 ml whole milk
25 g fresh yeast
75 g soft butter
450 g flour
50 g sugar
1 pinch of salt
For the cinnamon filling:
90 g soft butter
50 g cinnamon sugar I use the one from Diamant
1 tsp baking cocoa powder
optional: 1 pinch of ground cardamom
also:
1 egg whisked with a little milk
caster sugar

Instructions
Prepare the Dough:
Warm the milk in a small pot until hand-warm (not hot). Set aside 5-6 tbsp of milk, mix with crumbled fresh yeast until dissolved. 
Add the butter (in cubes) to the remaining milk and melt over low heat, ensuring the milk stays warm, not hot.
Mix Ingredients:
In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt. Add the yeast mixture and milk with butter. 
Knead with a mixer or by hand until a smooth, elastic dough forms that doesn’t stick to the bowl. 
If needed, add a tiny bit of flour. Shape into a ball, place in a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a towel, and let rise in a warm, draft-free spot for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
Roll Out:
Punch down the dough and roll it out on a lightly floured surface into a 40 x 60 cm (16 x 24 in) rectangle. 
If the dough shrinks back, wait a few minutes and try again.
Prepare the Filling:
Mix butter, cinnamon sugar, and cocoa powder until smooth. Spread evenly over the dough.

Shape the Rolls:
Fold the dough in thirds like a letter. 
Slice into 12 strips (about 2 cm wide). 
Twist each strip, then coil into a spiral like a snail shell, tucking the end underneath. 
Place on baking sheets lined with parchment, leaving space between them. 
Cover with a towel and let rise for another 30 minutes.

Bake:
Preheat the oven to 200°C (390°F). Brush rolls with beaten egg, sprinkle with pearl sugar, and bake for 13-15 minutes until golden.
